# Project Status Report - 02/11/2026
## High Level Goal 
- Have a chess bot that can play a game and can train off of one person's data, begin preparations for training off multiple peoples' data, and have a front-end that allows users to play against the bot.

## Original Goals for the Week
- Mason
  - Set up code coverage tests (2 days)
  - Update scrum board & keep it organized (throughout the week)
  - Create internal documentation for auto-formatting and linting tools used in the project (2 days)
  - Assist data team with database code & code reviews as needed (3 days)
- Danyuan
  - write evaluation file for ML (2-3 days)
  - meet with the ML team to talk about the PRs that shreyan put up and come up with some plans for next steps (1 day)
- Lebam
- Shreyan
  - Work on fleshing out implementations for ML-UI interaction (2 days)
  - Write 10 more test cases (1 day)
- William
  - Finish training-related functions and begin integration with an existing model (2 days)
  - Perform additional feature engineering and evaluate potential models with different features (1-2 days)
- Raghav
  - Finish the Agent (1 day)
  - Review existing prs (1 day)
  - Create(and test) endpoints for ML pipeline - make move, train, etc (1-2 days)
  - Work with team to figure out and then work on what features we want to input to our model (1-2 days)

## Progress and Issues

    - Built the demo for the Beta Release
    - Wrote frontend tests
  - Issues/Blockers:
    - Still need to figure out ML-UI interaction
- William
  - Progress:
    - Finished training-related functions for ML pipeline
    - Performed code reviews on ML-related commits (test files, evaluation code, agent code)
    - Set up basic presentation slides structure and did introduction/motivation slide
- Raghav
