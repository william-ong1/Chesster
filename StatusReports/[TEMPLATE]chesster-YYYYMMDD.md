# Project Status Report - MM/DD/YYYY
## High Level Goal 
- Describe in one line the overarching goal of your next release, which may take multiple weeks to achieve. Example: Develop frontend to backend working software for the Beta Release, showcasing feature X. This serves to keep everyone aligned with the overall vision to which you're working.

## Original Goals for the Week 
- This section should be an exact copy of the last section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.

## Progress and Issues
### Progress
- Report on progress: what you did, what worked, what you learned.

### Issues
- Report on issues: where you had trouble, and where you are blocked.

## Questions for the Product Owner 
- List any questions for your TA to be discussed in your Thursday project meeting.

## Goals for Next Week 
- Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate (no longer than a week). We recommend that you label these with the student(s) who is responsible for the item.
