# Project Status Report - 02/04/2026
## High Level Goal 
- Have a chess bot that can play a game and can train off of one person's data, and a front-end that allows users to play against the bot.

## Original Goals for the Week
- Complete the Architecture and Design assignment (throughout the week: all)
- Complete ML Pipeline Architecture (5-6 days: William, Raghav, Shreyan)
- Inter-component integration plan (2 days: Mason, Lebam)
- Data Pipeline Architecture (5-6 days: Mason, Danyuan)
- UI Plan (2 days: Shreyan, Lebam)

## Progress and Issues
### Progress
- Added/updated the following information in our Development Process Description:
  - Updated risk assessment
  - Updated project schedule
  - Updated team structure
  - Created a test plan
  - Created a documentation plan
- Defined our software architecture and software design plans
- Defined our coding guidelines
- Created a software architecture diagram showing how the UI/UX, data pipeline, and ML pipline interact with each other

### Issues
- We are currently unsure how to make our Python and TypeScript code interact with each other

## Questions for the Product Owner 
- None yet

## Goals for Next Week 
- Everyone works together on:
  - Complete Testing & Continuous Integration assignment (throughout the week)
  - Decide on testing infrastructure & CI service (1 day)
  - Set up test-automation infrastructure & CI service (1-2 days)
- Each team (Data, ML, UI/UX) works separately on:
  - Design testing suite specific to the team's needs at a high level (4-5 days)
  - Begin writing tests (if time allows)
- Data-specific Goals (Mason, Danuyan, Lebam):
- UI/UX-specific Goals (Lebam, Shreyan):
- ML-specific Goals (Danuyan, William, Raghav, Shreyan):
