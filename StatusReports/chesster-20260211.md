# Project Status Report - 02/04/2026
## High Level Goal 
- Have a chess bot that can play a game and can train off of one person's data, and a front-end that allows users to play against the bot.

## Original Goals for the Week
- Everyone works together on:
  - Complete Testing & Continuous Integration assignment (throughout the week)
  - Decide on testing infrastructure & CI service (1 day)
  - Set up test-automation infrastructure & CI service (1-2 days)
- Each team (Data, ML, UI/UX) works separately on:
  - Design testing suite specific to the team's needs at a high level (4-5 days)
  - Begin writing tests (if time allows)
- Data-specific Goals (Mason, Danyuan, Lebam):
  - Set up Mongo DB (2 days: Mason, Lebam)
  - Create outline for pipeline code (3 days: all)
- UI/UX-specific Goals (Lebam, Shreyan):
  - Convert UI prototype into HTML/TypeScript & CSS (3 days: Shreyan, Lebam)
  - Ensure legal moves work (if time allows)
- ML-specific Goals (Danyuan, William, Raghav, Shreyan, Lebam):
  - Get familiarized with the Sunfish NNUE Chess Bot (throughout the week: all)
  - Implement Sunfish NNUE locally and fine-tune to one of our team member's chess data (5 days: all)

## Progress and Issues
- Mason
  - Progress:
    - set up CI for the GitHub repo using GitHub actions
    - found and set up config files for the team to use for linting and auto-formatting code
    - completed code reviews for database code
  - Issues/Blockers:
    - CI code was tested in a separate repo, but is currently unable to pass tests because of pending pull requests
- Danyuan
  - Progress
    - Meetings with Data team
    - Coordinated meetings between ML & Data
- Lebam
  - Progress
    - Meetings with Data team
    - coordinated on UI
- Shreyan
  - Progress:
    - Create basic scaffolding, reference code, and tests for ML, data, and backend
    - Ported over frontend from Figma Make
    - Helped write up the Weekly Update
  - Issues/Blockers:
    - Need to get pull requests code reviewed
- William
  - Progress:
    - Begin template code for ML pipeline, specifically training step
    - Brainstorm with ML team on model architecture and additional design decisions for feature engineering and input data
    - Reviewed CI/CD integration and test cases
- Raghav
  - Progress:
    - Worked with ML team to revise ML architecture in order for our bots to have better generalization in unseen states during play
    - Created codeowners to help with code reviews
    - Reviewed and discussed some of the prs that were created
  - Issues/Blockers:
    - We needed to address prs before implementing new ML architecture and revising application
- General issues
  - Hiding API key/URI info in our GitHub repo

## Questions for the Product Owner 
- How should we hide info like API keys and the URI of our database in our GitHub repo?

## Goals for Next Week 
- Mason
  - Set up code coverage tests (2 days)
  - Update scrum board & keep it organized (throughout the week)
  - Create internal documentation for auto-formatting and linting tools used in the project (2 days)
  - Assist data team with database code & code reviews as needed (3 days)
- Danyuan
  - write evaluation file for ML (2-3 days)
  - meet with the ML team to talk about the PRs that shreyan put up and come up with some plans for next steps (1 day)
- Lebam
- Shreyan
  - Work on fleshing out implementations for ML-UI interaction (2 days)
  - Write 10 more test cases (1 day)
- William
  - Finish training-related functions and begin integration with an existing model (2 days)
  - Perform additional feature engineering and evaluate potential models with different features (1-2 days)
- Raghav
  - Finish the Agent (1 day)
  - Review existing prs (1 day)
  - Create(and test) endpoints for ML pipeline - make move, train, etc (1-2 days)
  - Work with team to figure out and then work on what features we want to input to our model (1-2 days)
